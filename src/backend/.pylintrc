[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the following messages:
# R0903: Too few public methods (Models often have few methods)
# R0913: Too many arguments (Constructors often need many args)
# R0917: Too many positional arguments
# W0718: Catching too general exception (Top level catch-all is valid for function apps)
# W1203: Use lazy % formatting (f-strings are cleaner and performance diff is negligible here)
# W0603: Using global statement (Valid for function app caching)
# C0301: Line too long (Relaxing to 120)
# R0911: Too many return statements (7/6 is acceptable for a main handler function with multiple validation steps)
