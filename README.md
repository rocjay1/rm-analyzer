# rm-analyzer

## Overview

**rm-analyzer** is a professional, modular Python project designed to automate the summarization of expense data and email reporting using AWS Lambda, S3, and SES. The project is fully type-checked, robustly tested, and features modern CI/CD for seamless deployment.

## Features

- **Modular Python Package**: All business logic is organized in the `rmanalyzer/` package, with clear separation of models, configuration, AWS utilities, transaction processing, and email generation.
- **AWS Lambda Ready**: The entry point (`main.py`) is a thin Lambda handler that leverages the package modules. Designed for S3-triggered execution.
- **Type Safety**: Uses `mypy` and type hints throughout for maximum reliability.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes both unit and edge case tests (`tests/`), using `unittest` and `moto` for AWS mocking.
- **Modern CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow runs tests, type checks, and deploys to AWS Lambda via the Serverless Framework on every push to `main`.
- **Easy Configuration**: Reads summary configuration from S3, validates it, and assigns transactions to people and categories.
- **Automated Emailing**: Generates and sends summary emails via AWS SES.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Data**: Export your transaction data as CSV from your financial app and upload it to the designated S3 bucket.
2. **Lambda Trigger**: The S3 `PUT` event triggers the Lambda function (`main.py`).
3. **Config Loading**: The function loads and validates configuration (people, accounts, emails, owner) from a separate S3 bucket.
4. **Transaction Processing**: Transactions are parsed, assigned to people, and summarized by category.
5. **Email Generation**: A summary email is constructed and sent to the configured recipients using AWS SES.

### Example CSV Input

```csv
Date,Original Date,Account Type,Account Name,Account Number,Institution Name,Name,Custom Name,Amount,Description,Category,Note,Ignored From,Tax Deductible
2023-08-31,2023-08-31,Credit Card,SavorOne,1313,Capital One,MADCATS DANCE,,150,MADCATS DANCE,Entertainment & Rec.,,,
2023-09-04,2023-09-04,Credit Card,CREDIT CARD,1234,Chase,TIKICAT BAR,,12.66,TIKICAT BAR,Dining & Drinks,,,
2023-09-12,2023-09-12,Cash,Spending Account,2121,Ally Bank,FISH MARKET,,47.71,FISH MARKET,Groceries,,,
```

### Example Config (JSON)

```json
{
  "People": [
     { "Name": "George", "Accounts": [1234], "Email": "boygeorge@gmail.com" },
     { "Name": "Tootie", "Accounts": [1313], "Email": "tuttifruity@hotmail.com" }
  ],
  "Owner": "bebas@gmail.com"
}
```

## Project Structure

```
main.py                  # Lambda entry point
rmanalyzer/              # Modular package (models, config, aws_utils, transactions, emailer)
tests/                   # Unit and edge case tests
requirements.txt         # Runtime dependencies
test_requirements.txt    # Test/development dependencies
serverless.yml           # Serverless Framework config
.github/workflows/       # CI/CD pipeline
.gitignore               # Ignores venv, cache, etc.
```

## Development & Testing

1. **Setup**: Use Python 3.13+ and create a virtual environment.
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r test_requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run tests**:
    ```sh
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
4. **Type check**:
    ```sh
    mypy rmanalyzer
    ```

## CI/CD & Deployment

- On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions runs all tests, type checks, and (if successful) deploys the Lambda using the Serverless Framework.
- Lambda runs on Python 3.13 and only includes the necessary code and dependencies.

## Key Technologies

- **Python 3.13**
- **AWS Lambda, S3, SES**
