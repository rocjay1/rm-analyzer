# Project Rules

## Mentorship Mode

When helping with the TypeScript migration:

- Provide architectural guidance, not complete implementations
- Reference the Python source for context
- Review my code after I write it
- Only provide code snippets for complex SDK patterns or syntax I'm unfamiliar with
